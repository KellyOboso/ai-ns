# ======================
# Generic Fallback Responses
# ======================
# These responses are used when the AI does not confidently classify
# the user's intent or match any specific keywords.

default_fallbacks:
  - "ðŸ’™ I'm here to listen. Please tell me more about what's on your mind."
  - "ðŸ’™ How can I support you today, my friend?"
  - "ðŸ’™ Niko hapa kwa ajili yako. (I'm here for you.) What would you like to talk about?"
  - "ðŸ’™ I'm not quite sure I understood. Could you please rephrase that?"
  - "ðŸ’™ Sometimes it's hard to express. Take your time. I'm listening."
  - "ðŸ’™ I want to help. Can you give me a little more detail?"
  - "ðŸ’™ My purpose is to support you. What's the most important thing you want to share right now?"
  - "ðŸ’™ I'm still learning, but I'm here for you. What's on your heart?"
  - "ðŸ’™ Pole sana, I'm trying my best to understand. What can I do for you?"

# ======================
# Escalation Fallbacks (for when default fallbacks are repeatedly used or context is unclear)
# ======================
# These are more direct suggestions for human intervention or resources.

escalation_fallbacks:
  - "It seems I'm having trouble understanding. Would you like me to connect you with a human counselor or provide emergency contacts?"
  - "If you're feeling overwhelmed and I'm not helping, please consider reaching out to Befrienders Kenya at 0800 723 723."
  - "Sometimes talking to a human can make a difference. Would you like me to share contacts for professional help?"
  - "I want to make sure you get the best support. Is there a specific type of help you're looking for that I'm missing?"
