## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run Kelly AI on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url> # Replace with your actual repository URL
    cd Final-project
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project (same level as `app.py`) and add your admin credentials:
    ```
    # .env
    ADMIN_EMAIL="kellyoboso@gmail.com"
    ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH="PASTE_YOUR_BCRYPT_HASH_HERE"
    ```
    **To generate the `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`:**
    Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    python -c "import bcrypt; print(bcrypt.hashpw(b'YourStrongAdminPasswordHere', bcrypt.gensalt()).decode())"
    ```
    Replace `'YourStrongAdminPasswordHere'` with your desired strong password. Copy the output and paste it into your `.env` file.

### Database Setup & Model Training

This step initializes the databases and trains the AI model. **You must run this at least once, and every time you modify the YAML data files.**

1.  **Delete old database files (if they exist from previous runs):**
    ```bash
    rm users.db data/mental_health_chatbot.db
    ```
    (On Windows, use `del users.db data\mental_health_chatbot.db` or delete them manually.)

2.  **Run the training script:**
    ```bash
    python3 train.py
    ```
    This will:
    * Create `users.db` (for user accounts, conversations, stories).
    * Create `data/mental_health_chatbot.db` (for logging training data attributes).
    * Train the NLU model based on your YAML data and save it as `models/intent_classifier.joblib` and `models/label_encoder.joblib`.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
2.  Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:8501`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Admin Dashboard Features

Access the Admin Dashboard by logging in with your `ADMIN_EMAIL`.

* **Users:** View and manage user accounts.
* **Conversations & Training Data:** Monitor conversation statistics and the training data log.

* **Manage Plans:** **(New!)** Update user subscription plans (e.g., to Premium for a month) and set expiration dates.
* **Add Training Data:** **(New - Developer Feature!)** Manually add new user input patterns and assign them to intents directly through the UI.
    * **Important:** After adding data via the Admin Dashboard, you **must manually run `python3 train.py` in your terminal** and then **restart `streamlit run app.py`** for the new data to be incorporated into the AI model. This step is for development/data curation only.
